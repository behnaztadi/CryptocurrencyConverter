The solution contains the following projects:

- **Web App** : is a simple UI which triggers the cryptocurrency calculations.
- **Cryptocurrency Calculator** : It gets the exchange rates from Exchange Rates service and calculate the quote for incoming cryptocurrency symbol.
- **Exchange Rate** : An Api which load and distribute the list of exchange rates against base currency, per request from the Message Broker. This project is an Api Core project, but it could be an console app as well.
